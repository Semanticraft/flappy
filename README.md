CS50’s Introduction to Game Development - Project 1   

The goal of this project is to deepen the understanding of Lua and LÖVE by influencing the generation of pipes, giving the player medals based on their performance and implementing a pause feature.  

The game can be started by following the instructions in https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started.
